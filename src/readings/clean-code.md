## Introduction

In this book is demostrate how to make your code clean and make the future changes are much easier. 
   
 - There are two parts tp learning craftsmanship: Knowledge & work.
 - Developing clean code like learing to ride a bicyele, it is `Hard work`.

## Chapert 1 : Clean Code
- Programmers will never be ride and code will be there.
- Code is really "Language" that will translate our requirments into instractions to machaines.
- `You are writing bad code becuse you have short deadline & you need to be fast` That is wrong.
- Never Say I will clean my Code later `Later equal never`.
- Keping your code clean is not just cost effective; it's a matter of professional survival.
- Bad Code isn't cuse by Short deadlines, bad managers or changing requriments. its becuse we are unprofessionals.
- It is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don't understand the risks of making messes.
- we are authors!, Our code should be readable to other programmers like  reading Novel.


#### What is Clean Code?

- Gardy Boosh `Clean Code is simple and direct & reads like will-written prose`.
- Dave Thomas Boosh `Clean Code can be read, enhanced by a developer other than it is orginal author, has acceptance tests and meaningfull names`.
- Michael Feathers `Clean code  always looks like it was written by someone who cares`.
- Ron Jeffries `simple code has Runs all tests, Contains no duplications, Expresse all desgine ideas in the system, minimize the number of entities like classes , methods and functions`.
- Ward Cunningham `You konw you are working on clean code whrn each routine you read turns out to be as you expected, Beautifull code when the code also makes it look like  language was made for the problem`.

#### The Boy Scout Rule
It is not enough to write code well. The code has to be kept clean over time, So we have to follwo the Rule `Leave the campground cleaner than you found it`. It means keep cleaning your code everytime you read it. like change varible Name, breake a function that is too large and keep cleaning. 

#### Conclusion
This book will not make you an artist or  a good programmer. it will give you the tools and techiques, the processes that other artits have to used then you have to keep Parctice until become a good programmer.



## Chapert 2 : Meaningful Names
- Names are everywhere in system, in Classes, Functions,Files, Directories..etc. 
- Chossing Good name takes time but saves more than it takes.
- The name of class, varible or function should answer all the big questions why is there , what is doing and how is dowing.
